{"name":"node-redis-promised","tagline":"A Redis client for Node with Promise support","body":"This is a complete promise-ready Redis client for node.js based on [mranney/node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis). It supports all Redis commands. This library adds promise support while also maintaining the original callback support.\r\n\r\nInstall with:\r\n\r\n    npm install redis-promised\r\n\r\nPieter Noordhuis has provided a binding to the official `hiredis` C library, which is non-blocking and fast. To use `hiredis`, do:\r\n\r\n    npm install hiredis redis-promised\r\n\r\nIf `hiredis` is installed, `redis-promised` will use it by default. Otherwise, a pure JavaScript parser will be used.\r\n\r\nIf you use `hiredis`, be sure to rebuild it whenever you upgrade your version of node. There are mysterious failures that can happen between node and native code modules after a node upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nMIT http://brandon.mit-license.org\r\n","google":"UA-42946241-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
